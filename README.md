History
------------

Old grizzled veteran of the python string library wars in the 2000's. He fled from zope and fell in with Twisted.

When he was running Europe's biggest games retailer's websites (gameplay.com) on a couple of RHEL boxes with less CPU than his desktop 
he discovered the joys of caching.

Now he caches everything. Keys, wallets, phones and coffee mainly.

Following a brief dalliance with VB, SQL Server and Java he was married to PHP which has been his rock and bread and butter for at least 20 years.

When his kids were tiny they would sit on his lap as he programmed in to the night when they were teething and now when they come home from the nightclub
he sits crosslegged on the floor contemplating services and brackets, arrays and data structures.

Philoso-py
-------------

Python will always stand head and shoulders above all other languages even if it's a royal pain to use sometimes.
